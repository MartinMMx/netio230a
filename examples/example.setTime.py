# example how to use the netio230a class

## import the netio230a class:
import netio230a
## for sys.exit(1)
import sys


from datetime import datetime
### for timedelta()
from datetime import timedelta

## for time.sleep()
import time

host = "192.168.1.2"
pw = "your choosen password"
tcp_port = 23

        print("could not connect")
        sys.exit(1)
    systemTime = netio.getSystemTime()
    netio.setSystemTime(datetime.now()+timedelta(seconds=20))
    time.sleep(0.9) # we have to wait (the new time has to be set first, which takes approx. 0.75 seconds)
    newSystemTime = netio.getSystemTime()
    
    netio = None
    
    print("\n--------- successfully queried the Koukaam NETIO 230A ---------")
