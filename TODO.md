TODO

Class
-----

* switch on port for a configurable amount of time (to make coffee).
  (this can be done by setting the timer! SNTP should be however disabled for security reasons!)
* implement the watchdog functionality (representation in port class)
* implement the timer functionality (representation in port class)
* maybe cleanup of the mixed use of mixedCase and lower_case_with_underscores
  (the latter is preferred).
* type safety (?!)

Other
-----

* Investigate whether the fakeserver could be implemented using [twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com).
